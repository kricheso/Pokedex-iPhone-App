This iPhone app uses AlamoFire in order to get stats of the pokemon. The stats are pulled from the Pokemon API. Pokemon are displayed in a collection view with a search feature as well. Pokemon music plays in the background automatically, however, the user can mute it by pressing on the music icon.
